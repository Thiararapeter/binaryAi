# binaryAi
Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. We are building a research platform that both advances the state of the art in AI and ensures that it is deployed safely and securely.

We are a non-profit organization and our research is open source. Our team is composed of a diverse group of researchers, engineers, and scientists from around the world.

We work with a wide range of partners, including universities, companies, and governments, to build a future where artificial general intelligence is beneficial to all.

We believe that the development of powerful AI should be shaped by human values, and that access to AI should be widely distributed throughout the world.

We are committed to open and transparent research, which we share through our publications, open source software, and events. We also believe that open dialogue and collaboration are essential for making progress in AI safety and security.

Thank you for your interest in OpenAI. We look forward to working with you to create a better future.
