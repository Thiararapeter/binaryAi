We believe that the development of powerful AI should be shaped by human values, and that access to AI should be widely distributed throughout the world.

We are committed to open and transparent research, which we share through our publications, open source software, and events. We also believe that open dialogue and collaboration are essential for making progress in AI safety and security.

Thank you for your interest in OpenAI. We look forward to working with you to create a better future.
